# On-Chain interaction between Solidity Smart Contracts

This project demonstrates a basic on-chain API-like contract use. It aims to establish a simple way for a developer to interact with multiple contracts at the same time just calling a single end-point. It provides full testing functionallity and extensive comments to provide some insight about how it actually works.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
I am totally unaware if there is an EIP for similar use cases. Any improvements are welcome!
